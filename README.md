# Systems_Orcad
Systems and Control project using Orcad. Transfer function simulation, design, and circuit analysis
Download the whole source file and you have to use Orcad's full version to open all projects.
Student version will limit you to certain number of nodes. You cannot open a simulation file and run it, you have to run the opj files.
Report of all listed systems, circuits, and simulations are on this google drive link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=17StetO1es-QUmD5W5p7S2DAie3f6A1k0
